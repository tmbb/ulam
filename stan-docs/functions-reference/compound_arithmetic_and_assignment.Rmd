Compound arithmetic and assignment statements combine an arithmetic
operation and assignment, replacing a statement such as

```
 x = x op y;
```

with the more compact compound form

```
 x op= y;
```

For example, `x = x + 1;` may be replaced with `x += 1;`.  This works
for all types that support arithmetic, including the scalar
types `int`, `real`, `complex`, the real matrix types `vector`,
`row_vector`, and `matrix`, and the complex matrix types,
`complex_vector`, `complex_row_vector`, and `complex_matrix`.


## Compound addition and assignment

Compound addition and assignment works wherever the corresponding
addition and assignment would be well formed.  

<!-- void; operator+=; (T x, U y); -->
\index{{\tt \bfseries operator\_compound\_add }!{\tt (T x, U y): void}|hyperpage}

`void` **`operator+=`**`(T x, U y)`<br>\newline
`x += y` is equivalent to `x = x + y`.  Defined for all types `T` and `U`
where `T = T + U` is well formed.

## Compound subtraction and assignment

Compound addition and assignment works wherever the corresponding
subtraction and assignment would be well formed.

<!-- void; operator-=; (T x, U y); -->
\index{{\tt \bfseries operator\_compound\_subtract }!{\tt (T x, U y): void}|hyperpage}

`void` **`operator-=`**`(T x, U y)`<br>\newline
`x -= y` is equivalent to `x = x - y`.  Defined for all types `T` and `U`
where `T = T - U` is well formed.

## Compound multiplication and assignment

Compound multiplication and assignment works wherever the corresponding
multiplication and assignment would be well formed.

<!-- void; operator*=; (T x, U y); -->
\index{{\tt \bfseries operator\_compound\_mulitply }!{\tt (T x, U y): void}|hyperpage}

`void` **`operator*=`**`(T x, U y)`<br>\newline
`x *= y` is equivalent to `x = x * y`.  Defined for all types `T` and `U`
where `T = T * U` is well formed.
`r since("2.17, complex signatures added in 2.30")`



## Compound division and assignment

Compound division and assignment works wherever the corresponding
division and assignment would be well formed.

<!-- void; operator/=; (T x, U y); -->
\index{{\tt \bfseries operator\_compound\_divide }!{\tt (T x, U y): void}|hyperpage}

`void` **`operator/=`**`(T x, U y)`<br>\newline
`x /= y` is equivalent to `x = x / y`.  Defined for all types `T` and `U`
where `T = T / U` is well formed.
`r since("2.17, complex signatures added in 2.30")`



## Compound elementwise multiplication and assignment

Compound elementwise multiplication and assignment works wherever the corresponding
multiplication and assignment would be well formed.

<!-- void; operator.*=; (T x, U y); -->
\index{{\tt \bfseries operator\_compound\_elt\_mulitply }!{\tt (T x, U y): void}|hyperpage}

`void` **`operator.*=`**`(T x, U y)`<br>\newline
`x .*= y` is equivalent to `x = x .* y`.  Defined for all types `T` and `U`
where `T = T .* U` is well formed.
`r since("2.17, complex signatures added in 2.30")`



## Compound elementwise division and assignment

Compound elementwise division and assignment works wherever the corresponding
division and assignment would be well formed.

<!-- void; operator./=; (T x, U y); -->
\index{{\tt \bfseries operator\_compound\_elt\_divide }!{\tt (T x, U y): void}|hyperpage}

`void` **`operator./=`**`(T x, U y)`<br>\newline
`x ./= y` is equivalent to `x = x ./ y`.  Defined for all types `T` and `U`
where `T = T ./ U` is well formed.
